About Luke's Guitar Shop
Luke's Guitar Shop was founded in 2022 by Luke Walden, a guitar enthusiast turned full-time dealer with a passion for connecting players with quality pre-owned instruments.
Our Story
What started as a love for guitars has grown into a thriving online business dedicated to buying, selling, and trading used guitars. While we operate exclusively online for now, the dream of opening a physical storefront one day keeps us motivated and growing.
What We Offer
We specialize in pre-owned guitars, with a carefully curated selection that changes regularly. You'll also find amps, parts, and accessories listed from time to time. Every instrument is inspected and honestly described so you know exactly what you're getting.
Where to Find Us
You can find our listings on Reverb, eBay, Sweetwater Gear Exchange, and Facebook Marketplace—but your best price will always be right here on our shop page. We cut out the middleman fees and pass those savings directly to you.
Easy, Secure Checkout
No account needed—just browse and buy. All payments are securely processed through Stripe or PayPal. Need a payment plan? PayPal Pay Later makes it easy to spread out your purchase.
Our Promise
Every purchase from Luke's Guitar Shop includes free shipping, fully covered by us. We believe in making the buying process as smooth and affordable as possible, so you can focus on what matters: finding your next great instrument.
